I installed DBI, which is required for interfacing R with databases, and RSQLite to enable interaction with SQLite files. Since my datasets were quite large, I transitioned from Excel to SQLite for more efficient querying and storage. To make my project interactive and user-friendly, I chose the Shiny framework and used Plotly to build interactive visualizations.
